# Godot Toolkit
A collection of scripts for Godot 4 that can be used in all kind of projects.

Varying from a State Machine to different utilities classes, I'll keep this growing over time. This is mostly for me, to keep things I normally use in my games quickly available, but feel free to use them or contribute your own.

Some of these are inspired by the amazing Firebelley and their [GodotUtilities](https://github.com/firebelley/GodotUtilities) for C#. Check it out if you use that language!
